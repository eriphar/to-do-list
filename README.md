## Description:
This program provides a simple command-line interface for managing a to-do list.

## Features:
* Add tasks to the to-do list.
* View current tasks.
* Remove tasks from the list.
* Prevents adding duplicate tasks.
* Informs you if the to-do list is empty.
* Case-insensitive task handling.

## How to Use:
1. Run the Python script.
2. Select options from the menu:
    * A: Add a new task.
    * V: View your to-do list.
    * R: Remove a task.
    * E: Exit the program.
3. Follow the prompts to add, view, or remove tasks.

Example:
* To add a task, select 'A' and enter the task description when prompted.
* To view your list, select 'V'.
* To remove a task, select 'R' and enter the task ID to be removed.

## Notes:
* Task names are case-insensitive.
* The list is stored in memory and will be lost when the program exits.

## Future Enhancements:
* Potentially store tasks to a file for future reference.
* Potentially include sub tasks
* Potentially include other attributes for tasks, for example, completion status.
